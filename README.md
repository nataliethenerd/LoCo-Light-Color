LoCo = Light Color. This project allows you to put a Game Boy Color in a Game Boy Light shell. Full Light colour PCB using the original parts. This board is made with modern screen kits in mind meaning it does not have the voltage rails for the original screen.

**ORDER AT 1MM WITH ENIG**

You can support me on Ko-Fi or by buying the board directly from me [my store](https://nataliethenerd.com/collections/all)

I also occasionally sell pre built PCBs on my store.

> [!WARNING]
> I am not responsible for your skill issues!

This board uses all the parts of an original Game Boy Color minus the IR and original screen circuit. Most parts are in the same spot, however if you are having trouble you can check the [interactive BOM](https://nataliethenerd.github.io/loco.html)

The thumbwheel circuit can be connected to an OSD screen to control brightness. The two touch pad wires and be connected to the pads labelled ↑↓ on the back top left side of the board. The select, A and B pads are easy connection pads for the screen also.

**My recommendations** 

- New power regulator like my [Safer Charge DC](https://nataliethenerd.com/products/safer-charge-dc)
- [Q5 OSD Game Boy Color screen](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmvDS95). The OSD allows you to move the screen
